Version 0.2 of Brine. A Secure Pickle Library for Signed / Encrypted Pickling. 

Brine utilizes Modern Strong Cryptography - AES-256 and Elliptic Curve Cryptography-521.

The pickle itself is encrypted with AES-256 with a randomly generated key. 
That key is then encrypted with the ECC Public Key for the Intended Reciepient.
The Encrypted pickle is then Signed with the Origin ECC Private Key ensure authenticity.


Please let me know what you think, I've got basic functionality implemented. Documentation is also coming. 

I will also be building a python standard package for this library.

If you have questions or requests for functionality please contact me.
